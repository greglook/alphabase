## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Basic base-32 support in the `alphabase.base32` namespace.

## [2.0.4] - 2019-03-23

### Fixed
- Remove reference to `javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter` in the `alphabase.hex`
  namespace for compatibility with Java 11, which moves that class to a separate
  module.

## [2.0.3] - 2019-01-20

### Fixed
- Fixed a few reflection warnings in `alphabase.bytes`.

## [2.0.2] - 2018-12-24

### Added
- `alphabase.bytes/copy-slice` returns a copy of a sequence of bytes inside a
  source array.
- `alphabase.bytes/concat` returns a byte array which is the concatenation of
  the arrays given as arguments.

## [2.0.1] - 2018-12-12

Note that this is a major release because of the removal of multibase support
from alphabase.

### Added
- `alphabase.bytes/bytes?` provides a cross-platform test for byte data.
- Added two new arities to `alphabase.bytes/copy` which simplify full cloning of
  a byte array and a full source write to an offset in dest.
- `alphabase.bytes/copy` returns the number of bytes copied in the
  multi-argument arities.
- `alphabase.bytes/compare` offers a lexicographic comparator for byte arrays.

### Removed
- **BREAKING:** Removed `alphabase.multi` in favor of a unified
  [`multiformats`](//github.com/greglook/clj-multiformats) codebase.

### Changed
- Removed `javax.xml.bind.DatatypeConverter` optimization for `:clj` in the hex
  namespace for Java 9+ compatibility.

## [1.0.0] - 2017-11-04

This project has been stable for a while now, so bumping the version to 1.0.0.

### Changed
- Update various dependencies.
- Migrate to CircleCI 2.0.

## [0.2.2] - 2016-12-15

### Added
- Add `alphabase.multi` with limited [multibase](https://github.com/multiformats/multibase)
  implementation using the existing hex and base58btc support.

### Changed
- Improve performance of hex coding in Clojure using core `DataTypeConverter`
  class.

## [0.2.1] - 2016-07-25

### Fixed
- Minor bug when decoding a string with invalid characters in Clojure.

## [0.2.0] - 2016-03-07

### Added
- Add cljs tests using `doo`.
- `bytes/copy` provides a way to copy bytes from one array to another.
- `bytes/init-bytes` to initialize an array with a seq of values.

### Fixed
- `bytes/byte-seq` returns nil for nil inputs.
- `bigint-` functions are only emitted for `:clj`.
- Pure division and multiplication functions are used as a default, rather than
  just with `:cljs`.

## 0.1.0 - 2016-02-19

Initial project release.
